As ~~a [Vulcan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)>)~~ someone who is ultra logical ðŸ––, its no secret, I find code easier to read than humans ðŸ¤«.

Code is predictable, humans, on the most part, are not. You can give the same input to two people and get totally different outputs!

Jokes aside, this is what makes us, us. Individuality should be celebrated.

However, this can be a real challenge if talking to people does not come naturally. This page is my attempt to provide others with a user manual, for me.

My personality type is a [Turbulent Architect (INTJ-T)](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). While some things might not be an 100% match, it does provide a fairly accurate description of me and my traits. I am an introvert my happy place is normally in the background, with a coffee taking in as much information as possible.

## What I'm good at

- Seeing a problem from many angles and finding problems to solve.
- Attention to detail. I like things to be clean, clear and up-to-date.
- Putting my heart and soul into any project I am involved in. You will always get 110% even if its not visible, I will be putting it in.
- Once I'm "in" to a project, I can holding all the moving parts in my head.
- I have a mildly photographic memory.

## What I'm not good at

- In meetings I might be quite quiet and only provide input when prompted, especially if I'm new to the subject matter. It might appear that I am uninvested or uninterested but this is far from it - I like to absorb as much information as possible and really think and things through and be confident in my input, it's likely I'll feedback after a meeting.
- I don't have a CS degree but I do have loads of experience. I do worry I might not know a term or concept by its official name but its likely I know what it is once we start talking about it.

## How to work with me

- Give me time, I like to think and experiment
- Often to understand something I have to do it.
- I prefer Team/Slack for communication and a call/face-to-face when tone and context is important, like feedback.
- Flexible working. I have a family, sometimes I need to the school run or finish on time.
- I'm a night person. I'm not great in the mornings.

## What I like to be involved in

## How I like to receive feedback

- Be direct and via a call or face to face. Text based is fine but I want to make sure I can act on the feedback, positive or constructive. To do that I need to absorb as much as possible, written, verbal and visual.
