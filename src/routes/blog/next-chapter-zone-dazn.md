It's a clich√© to say, but news like this is always bitter-sweet. Even more so when you're leaving on a high.

**I have loved working at Zone.**

And I don't mean that loosely. I have **really loved** working at [Zone/Cognizant](https://zonedigital.com).

People. Projects. Work/life balance.

When I think back to the baby-faced youngster that walked in the door as a senior front-end developer, I was also going through a massive change in my personal life. I was juggling a lot. But always felt there was a team of people wanting me to succeed as much as I did.

7 years later, as a slightly grey-haired, lead front-end developer, I can, hand on my heart, say I have given it my all. Of course, I've been paid for my time, but I have taken away so much more; friends for life, skills and a whole new version of myself. I would not change a thing.

Some of my highlights have been; creating prototypes for BBC iPlayer, creating a ticket-buying platform for South West Trains, re-platforming Greene King pubs, creating a data-heavy DNA analysis tool for Genomics England and bringing online purchasing and configuration to the stairlift industry across 6 global markets, all during a pandemic with Stannah.

To all you Zoners, past and present, thank you.

## Where next?

I'm excited to announce I'll be joining [DAZN](https://www.dazn.com/) at the end of July, where I'll be working as a Software Engineer.

I was blown away during the interview process by the people, product, tech stack and architecture. So many talented engineers, doing so many amazing things! It was always going to take something epic to move on - I really feel I have found it.

Big thanks go to [Patrick Kunka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickkunka) who didn't give up on flagging this opportunity. It has been several years in the making!

I'm ready and cannot wait to get stuck in!
